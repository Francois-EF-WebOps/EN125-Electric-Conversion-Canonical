STUDENT FORK CHECKLIST

This checklist is mandatory reading before forking.

Purpose:
To help students learn safely, avoid common traps, and preserve lineage
with the canonical documentation.

BEFORE YOU FORK
[ ] I have read README.md
[ ] I understand this is not a kit or certification
[ ] I have read FREEZE.md
[ ] I understand why the documentation is frozen
[ ] I accept responsibility for my own safety and compliance

WHEN YOU FORK
[ ] Fork from release tag v1.0.0-canonical
[ ] Do not fork from an untagged branch
[ ] Rename the repository following the required naming convention
[ ] Update README.md to state what is different from EN125

AFTER YOU FORK
[ ] Add a clear “Differences from Canonical” section
[ ] Document frame differences explicitly
[ ] Document electrical differences explicitly
[ ] Do not remove safety sections
[ ] Do not downgrade specifications silently

WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO
[ ] Do not claim certification or approval
[ ] Do not present this as a finished product
[ ] Do not remove inspection or maintenance requirements
[ ] Do not skip frame analysis

GOOD PRACTICE
[ ] Keep changes minimal and well-documented
[ ] Add photos, sketches, and measurements
[ ] Treat this as engineering, not hacking
[ ] Ask questions publicly and document answers

Forking is learning.
Learning requires discipline.
