DOCUMENTATION FREEZE — v1.0.0 (CANONICAL)

Status: FROZEN
Date: [15/01/2569]

This repository is frozen as a canonical reference for educational and community use.

PURPOSE
This documentation defines a complete, safety-oriented framework for converting a 125cc internal combustion motorcycle to electric propulsion, using the Suzuki EN125 platform as a reference implementation.

The freeze exists to:
- Provide students and educators with a stable, non-moving baseline
- Prevent unsafe partial modifications or undocumented changes
- Enable consistent learning, discussion, and peer review
- Separate reference knowledge from experimentation

WHAT FREEZE MEANS
- Core documentation will not be edited retroactively
- No silent changes, clarifications, or “small fixes”
- No merging of experimental ideas into this version
- This repository functions as a reference specification

WHAT IS ALLOWED
- Forking the repository
- Brand-specific adaptations (Honda, Yamaha, etc.)
- Local regulatory extensions
- Translations
- Educational reuse (courses, workshops, study groups)

HOW IMPROVEMENTS HAPPEN
- Through forks
- Through appendices
- Through new, versioned releases (v1.1.0, v2.0.0, etc.)

This freeze is intentional.
It is not abandonment.
It is a stability guarantee.

Safety, clarity, and repeatability take priority over speed.
